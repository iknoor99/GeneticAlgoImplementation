There are four proposed projects, each of which runs for 3 years and has the following characteristics.
 
The available budget is 3.1 million for year 1, 2.5 million for year 2 and 0.4 million for your 3. The problem is to decide which projects to invest in order to maximize the total return.  

Variables: x1, x2, x3 and x4 are binary variables, representing the investment decisions of project 1, 2, 3, and 4. A value 1 indicating invest while a value 0 indicating donâ€™t invest.

The expected output:
When the program runs, you need to print:

1- the mutation probability, the size of the population

2- The individuals in each population and the fitness of each one of them

3- The individual selected for crossover

4- The generated children

5- back to step 2
